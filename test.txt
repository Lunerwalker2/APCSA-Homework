Assignments are in folders and not really sorted by assignment name, just the class names, because I'm not going to be asked to go back and match each class I have stored with what assignment it was for.

Any assignment that required a "tester" class (a class that had a main() method and tested a class/printed fields from a class) probably won't be here since I usually just overwrite one class that has a main method in it each time I need to.
