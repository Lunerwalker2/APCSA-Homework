# APCSA-Homework
Tentative storage for all APCSA HW I happen to complete early (or at all), because I wasted my life making them might as well get something out of it.
Keep in mind that I am not some programming god and there might be mistakes, and I also tend to do some things different from the way that
is shown, i.e. using this.variablename in constructors instead of two different names.


#"Organization"
Assignments are in folders and not really sorted by assignment name, just the class names,
because I'm not going to be asked to go back and match each class I have stored with what assignment it was for.

Any assignment that required a "tester" class (a class that had a main() method and tested a class/printed fields from a class) probably
won't be here since I usually just overwrite one class that has a main method in it each time I need to.
