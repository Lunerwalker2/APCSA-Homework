# APCSA-Homework
Tentative storage for all APCSA HW I happen to complete early (or at all), because I wasted my life making them might as well get something out of it.
Keep in mind that I am not some programming god and there might be mistakes, and I also tend to do some things different from the way that
is shown, i.e. using this.variablename in constructors instead of two different names.


# "Organization"
Assignments are in folders and not really sorted by assignment name, just the class names,
because I'm not going to be asked to go back and match each class I have stored with what assignment it was for.

Any assignment that required a "tester" class (a class that had a main() method and tested a class/printed fields from a class) probably
won't be here since I usually just overwrite one class that has a main method in it each time I need to.

In general, most of the "viewer" or "tester" classes assigned are the same format.

"Tester":
(inside main method), create object(s) or class, do some set() methods on them, then do System.out.println("Name of field: "+getField()).

"Viewer": (inside main method), create new JFrame object, set size, title, and default close behavior (usually JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE), make an object of the "component" class you made, do frame.add(component object), then do frame.visible(true).


Remember that you gained inspiration from these after already completely understanding how to do them.
